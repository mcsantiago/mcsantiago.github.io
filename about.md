I'm a software engineer focused on web applications and creating AI-powered tools. Recently, I've developed a keen interest in computer graphics and animation applications, specifically in computer graphics rendering with a focus on ray tracing techniques and real-time rendering.

I'm aiming to transition into the computer graphics field, concentrating on creating tools that help artists achieve specific effects in real-time applications. I'm currently learning Apple's Metal API and PBR techniques. I've worked on both CPU and GPU powered ray tracing systems, which I hope will serve as a sandbox for more complex projects like implementing BRDF models.

I find computer graphics an amazing way to understand and recreate how we see the world. I'm passionate and curious about 
learning more, and I love helping others appreciate the same beauty I see in it.
