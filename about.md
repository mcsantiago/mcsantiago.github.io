Some information about me!

### Background

I am a software developer who likes to dabble in a little bit of anything that I find interesting. Currently, I am 
a full-time software engineer for T-Mobile and a Masters candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas
in Computer Science specializing in Intelligent Systems. I received my Bachelors of Science in Bioinformatics at 
Baylor University with a minor in Biochemistry (I put in the work, might as well flaunt the minor right?). 

### Hobbies

In my free time, I like to develop small side projects including video game prototypes, machine learning / AI 
projects, and web apps. I also really enjoy hiking and backpacking!
